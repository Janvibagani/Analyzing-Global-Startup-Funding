## Topic:

Analyzing Global Startup Funding Patterns Using Crunchbase Data


## Background and Introduction:

Startups have become a significant part of the global economy. From innovative tech solutions to new-age healthcare and sustainable energy ideas, they are constantly reshaping industries. However, behind every successful startup is a story of funding. The right investment at the right time often makes the difference between a startup that thrives and one that fades away.

In this project, we aim to explore how funding flows into startups, which sectors attract the most capital, and whether early investments shape long-term success. With so much data available, our focus is not just on numbers but on telling the story of how startups grow and how investors make funding decisions.

Through data visualizations, we intend to uncover these patterns and present insights in a way that is accessible and informative, even for individuals without a strong data background. The overall goal is to create a clear and engaging narrative around how the startup ecosystem operates, using real-world investment data.


## Hypothesis:

Startups in technology-driven sectors such as software, fintech, and healthtech receive higher funding amounts across all stages compared to traditional industries. Additionally, startups that raise larger funding amounts in their early stages (Seed, Series A) are more likely to secure follow-on funding and eventually reach later stages such as Series C, D, or IPO.


## Why this Hypothesis:

This hypothesis is based on real-world observations, where technology startups often appear to have greater scalability and disruptive potential, making them more attractive to investors. However, we want to validate this assumption using data. Is this perception supported by actual funding trends? Do early investments significantly impact a startupâ€™s long-term success?


## Why this Dataset? How does it support the hypothesis?

The dataset is sourced from Crunchbase, a trusted platform for tracking startup investments on a global scale. It includes detailed data such as:

- Which companies received funding  
- The amount raised  
- The industry they belong to  
- The funding stage (Seed, Series A, B, etc.)  
- Their geographical location  
- Who invested in them

This dataset is comprehensive, global, and spans multiple years and funding stages. It enables us to group startups by sector, track their funding journeys over time, and test our hypothesis with relevant data.

## Approach:

We will begin by cleaning and organizing the Crunchbase dataset to ensure that all the data is accurate, consistent, and ready for analysis. This includes standardizing industry names, handling missing data, and formatting funding amounts and funding stages appropriately.

Once the dataset is cleaned, we will conduct exploratory data analysis to identify trends such as which industries have received the most funding and which geographic regions have emerged as startup hubs.

To present our findings clearly, we will create various visualizations such as bar charts, pie charts, scatter plots, and maps to show how startup investment is distributed globally.

Finally, we will test our hypothesis by comparing the funding journeys of startups in different sectors and stages. The goal is to identify patterns and insights that could assist entrepreneurs and investors in making more informed funding decisions across the global startup ecosystem.
